(2, 'https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84157', 'Does the coronavirus affect male fertility?', 'There have been repeated suggestions on social media and in newspaper reports that COVID-19 might damage male fertility.\n \nThe concerns have in part arisen because the testes are known to produce the protein that the novel coronavirus is thought to use to get into cells (called ACE2). So theoretically the testes could be affected by the virus.\n \nThere is also some evidence that illness and high temperature caused by some infections including flu, can temporarily lower sperm count and increase the production of abnormal sperm, but this effect is short lived.\n \nOne study in 181 men from China found that men with COVID-19 seem to have changes in levels of some of their reproductive hormones compared to men without the virus but found no difference in testosterone levels. Two studies from China found no evidence of the virus in the semen of men who had recovered from COVID-19.\n \nNo studies so far have looked at important issues such as sperm count or quality, so there isn’t convincing evidence that COVID-19 impacts men’s fertility.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nIn March the Mail Online reported that a Professor in reproductive medicine from Wuhan suggested that coronavirus could affect the testes and that men who have had it should have fertility tests after recovery. The South China Morning Post reported that a similar report was published on the Hubei government website and widely shared on social media, before being removed.\n \n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe basis for the Professor’s claim was that the protein thought to be used by the novel coronavirus to enter cells (called ACE2) is found in the testes (among other places). So, cells in the testes could theoretically be infected by the virus, and this might affect sperm production. He stated that SARS, which was also caused by a coronavirus, had led to damage to the testes in some cases.\nHe acknowledged though that at that point there was no research to confirm an impact of coronavirus on male fertility.\nWe are starting to see a few early studies being published on this issue. These studies are generally small and often have not yet been through review by other experts to check that they are of good quality.\n \nA recent study coming out of Wuhan compared the levels of reproduction-related hormones in 81 men who had COVID-19 and 100 men who did not have the infection (controls).\nThe study found that the men with COVID-19 did show differences in the levels of some of their reproduction-related hormones, but not in testosterone levels. The research did not look at the men’s sperm counts or sperm quality, so we don’t know if these differed. Professor Paolo Madeddu from the University of Bristol commenting on the study noted that “Hormonal changes could be due to general inflammation affecting also the gonad function”.\nTwo studies in a small number of men (12 men and 34 men respectively) in China who had COVID-19 did not find any evidence of coronavirus being present in their semen after they recovered. The findings of one of these studies also suggested that testicular cells with the ACE2 protein lacked a second protein needed for the virus to enter the cells.\nOverall, there isn’t currently convincing evidence that coronavirus has an impact on male fertility.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nAs of the 23rd April, specific advice on coronavirus and male fertility had not been issued by sources such as the UK’s Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, the British Fertility Society, or the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\nCitation\n\nDaily Mail online.

But there is no evidence that African heritage offers any protection against coronavirus.\nIn the UK, many of the people who have sadly died of COVID-19 are of African or Caribbean descent. Indeed, research is underway to find out why people from black and minority ethnic groups in the UK seem more likely to become victims of the disease. Many African American people in the US have died of COVID-19, with death rates higher than those for the white population. At the time of writing, more than 16,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Africa.\nThe myth could be particularly dangerous if people of African descent believe themselves to be at lower risk of infection or serious illness when they are at equal or raised risk.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThe myth appears to have started after a young Cameroonian student in China contracted the virus. Some African news outlets said doctors were surprised that he had survived and put it down to his genes. As he was young, there’s nothing surprising about it. His ethnic background is unlikely to have anything to do with his survival.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe news reports are not credible for a number of reasons. They do not name the Chinese doctors who were supposedly surprised by the survival of the young student. They do not explain the claims that his survival was down to his “blood genetic composition”. They do not give the qualifications or affiliation of an “African doctor” who they quote as saying that melanin, the pigment which gives skin its colour, provides protection, and that “This proves yet again that the black man is indestructible.”\nIn addition to the flimsy facts, the reports are not based on any scientific understanding of how genetic variation might affect susceptibility to COVID-19.\nThere are many genetic variations even between individuals of the same ethnic group. Along with behavioural and health system factors these may influence survival in unknown ways. Looking for simple explanations to predict survival for people with this new virus is unlikely to be helpful.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe myth has been debunked by organisations including the World Economic Forum and Reuters news agency. The World Economic Forum says: “There is no proof that melanin protects black people from the coronavirus. There is also no scientific evidence that African blood composition prevents Africans from contracting the coronavirus.”\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nAfriupdate website.

Could the BCG vaccine reduce infections or deaths from the virus?\nClinical trials are underway, but at present, there is no good quality evidence that the BCG vaccination protects against COVID-19.\nThe UK, like most of Europe and the US, no longer routinely offers BCG vaccination to everyone because TB is not common in this country. BCG is used more widely in Asian and African countries where TB is still a problem. Some of these countries, despite being lower income than European countries, had lower COVID-19 reported cases and deaths.\nThe evidence at country level is interesting, but there are many problems with it. Countries are at different stages in the pandemic and have very different testing regimens. This variation could explain the differences in COVID-19 death rates.\nThe WHO and UK guidance continue to recommend the BCG vaccine for babies who are at higher risk of exposure to TB.\n \nA story in the Metro newspaper highlighted research on BCG vaccination and death rates from COVID-19 that was conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in the US. The media highlighted caution regarding the current level of evidence and said that “no final conclusions have been drawn.”\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Public Health study is the most detailed study to date to have investigated the link between COVID-19 death rates and BCG vaccination. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed, meaning the final publication may change, though early reporting is common in the rapidly evolving field of COVID-19 research.\nIt looked at deaths from COVID-19 per million of population for the 50 countries reporting the most cases of coronavirus as of 29 March 2020. Typically, death rates for infectious disease – including those from respiratory infection – are lowest for high income countries and highest for low income countries. However, for COVID-19, the reverse was true. The median (average) COVID-19 mortality rate was 0.4 per million for low-middle income countries rising to 5.5 for high income countries.\nThe researchers adjusted their figures to take account of the country’s economy (Gross Domestic Product, GDP), the percentage of the population aged over 65 years, and the stage in the epidemic (the number of days since the 100th case had been reported). These are all factors that are expected to be associated with disease severity and mortality in a respiratory infection like COVID-19. They then looked at death rates for those countries that did and did not offer universal BCG vaccination. They found countries that used BCG vaccine had COVID-19 death rates 5.8 times lower than countries that did not use BCG vaccine.\nHowever, this ecological research cannot account for differences in the level of testing and reporting by country, other confounding influences (such as the level of comorbidity and social distancing), or the rapidly evolving spread of the pandemic.\nOverall considerable caution must be taken in attributing these findings to a direct protective effect of the BCG vaccine.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe WHO says it will evaluate the results of the BCG trials underway, which reportedly involve healthcare workers. However, at present is says there is: “no evidence that the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus” and “WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19.”\nIt warns that diverting supplies of the vaccine from countries where it is currently used risks outbreaks of TB in those areas, and says that those countries which use the vaccine to protect babies from TB should continue to do so.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nA Shet, D Ray et al.

This figure doesn’t actually refer to smokers’ risk of catching the virus. Instead, the research in question found that smokers were about 14 times more likely than people who have never smoked to develop more serious COVID-19 disease when they do catch it.\nSmoking damages the lungs and the blood vessels of the heart. This may be why smokers who catch coronavirus are more likely to have serious complications than non-smokers. We know that people with lung and heart disease are more at risk of complications from COVID-19.\nSmoking cigarettes also means people touch their mouths frequently as they take puffs of a cigarette or pipe. Some types of smoking apparatus, such as water pipes, are typically shared. Touching your mouth frequently and sharing pipes is likely to increase the risk of catching the virus.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThe Sun’s article is based on a Public Health England (PHE) warning to smokers that they are more likely to suffer severe disease from coronavirus. Unfortunately, the Sun’s headline misreports the basis for this warning, as the research in question didn’t find that smokers are more likely to get coronavirus. Instead, it found that smokers were more likely to develop more serious COVID-19 disease.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe press release from Public Health England (PHE) said: “The evidence clearly shows COVID-19 virus attacks the respiratory system, which explains why smokers are at greater risk” of severe respiratory disease.\nThe PHE press release referenced a study published in the Chinese Medical Journal at the end of February. This study reported on 78 patients treated in hospitals in Wuhan Province in China in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak.\nAfter two weeks 67 of the 78 patients improved or stabilised while 11 deteriorated and developed more serious disease. Of those who got worse, 27% were smokers or former smokers, while only 3% of those who improved were smokers or former smokers. The researchers said that people who smoked were 14 times more likely to have deteriorated than non-smokers after taking into account other factors.\nOlder patients had higher temperatures or breathing difficulties on admission and were also more likely to deteriorate.\nIn addition, PHE said: “the repetitive hand to mouth movement provides an easy route of entry for the virus, putting smokers at greater risk of contracting COVID-19.”\nPHE said these concerns give an added incentive for smokers to stop smoking.\n\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organization says: “Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth.\nSmokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase the risk of serious illness.”\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n1.     Liu W et al.

It is present in saliva and mucus from the nose and is spread through tiny droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even speaks.\nInfection occurs when these droplets land in the mouths and noses of people nearby, but they can also be transmitted via the wet surface of the eyes.\nInfected people who have no symptoms may still pass on the infection.\nThe virus can survive on surfaces or objects and people can get infected by touching something contaminated and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. It is not thought to be a “blood-borne” virus, so is unlikely to be transmitted like malaria.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThe claim was originally published on Facebook but seems to have since been removed. It has also surfaced on a variety of other social media platforms as people speculated about where this new infection could have come from and how it could be spread.\nJoseph Conlon, a scientist from the American Mosquito Control Association says he has received claims that the American government is covering up information about this transmission route. He confirms that in his opinion “the possibility of mosquito transmission of the coronavirus is nil”.\n\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nCOVID-19 has been linked in many peoples’ minds with Zika, a previously little-known disease which spread from Africa to South and North America in 2015-2016, causing widespread concern. However, Zika is caused by a different sort of virus that spreads among humans by the bites of infected mosquitos.\nDespite the fact there is no evidence that coronavirus can infect mosquitos, the possibility continues to be raised.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organisation is quite clear that there is no evidence to date suggesting mosquitos can transmit coronavirus. It says infected droplets from the mouths and noses of people suffering the disease are the key route of transmission and reiterates the recommendation that frequent hand washing is the best way to protect oneself against it.\nSimilarly, the US Centers for Disease Control says it has no data suggesting COVID-19 is spread by mosquito or tick bites and says person to person contact is the main risk.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by RB\n \nCitation\n\nThe CD and WHO Have Already Said Mosquitos Don’t Spread Coronavirus.

However, not only is it untrue, but spraying yourself with chemicals such as chlorine or bleach could be dangerous.\nIt is unclear where the idea originated. Perhaps people thought that, as a disinfectant is used to clean surfaces, it might be useful for disinfecting people. However, spraying yourself with these substances will not help if the virus has already entered your body. Handwashing with soap is sufficient to remove the virus from your hands and prevent you from spreading it onto surfaces or transferring it to your mouth, eyes or nose.\nIf chemicals such as chlorine or bleach come into direct contact with your eyes or mucous membranes (such as inside your mouth and nose) this could damage them. Inhaling such sprays could also cause breathing difficulties.\nAlways use products in accordance with the guidance provided on the labels.\nWhere did the story come from?\nIt is unclear where the story originated. However, one widespread news report showed officials apparently spraying a mixture of chlorine and water over a group of migrant workers in Uttar Pradesh, India. The local government later blamed “overzealous” officials.\n\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThere is no scientific basis for the myth that spraying people with bleach or chlorine can “disinfect” those carrying the virus. These disinfectants work only to clean surfaces.\nIf a person has the virus that causes COVID-19, the cells inside their body are infected. The virus will be carried in their saliva and mucus, and so it will be spread in droplets of these fluids if they cough or sneeze. If people who are infected touch their mouths, eyes or noses, or cough or sneeze onto their hands, particles of the virus will get onto their hands. It can then be transferred from their hands onto other surfaces, where other people might pick it up.\nAlcohol-based hand sanitiser can be used to clean your hands if you are away from home and don’t have access to handwashing facilities.  However, spraying alcohol over the rest of your body is unlikely to bring any additional benefit.\nSpraying people with disinfectant will not stop transmission of the virus and spraying yourself will not stop you catching the virus or help in any way if you have already been exposed to the virus.\nThe best way to reduce your chances of being infected with coronavirus is to follow the accepted guidance about social distancing and washing hands frequently with soap and water.\n\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organization says: “Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).

That’s because bacteria are cells which can reproduce, while viruses are packages of genetic material which cannot reproduce until they get inside cells. The way viruses replicate is different from bacteria, so drugs need to work in different ways to affect them.\nHowever, antibiotics may be used if someone gets a bacterial infection on top of a viral infection – for example, if bacteria invade the lungs and cause bacterial pneumonia when someone is already ill with coronavirus.\nBecause of the pressing need for effective treatments for COVID-19, researchers are considering whether drugs already used for other conditions might have an effect, and this includes some antibiotics.\nFor example, an antibiotic called azithromycin is being tested in combination with antimalarial drugs in COVID-19 patients. Until the results of these studies are available, we won’t know if these drugs also have anti-viral activity.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThe Mail Online reported that “a team of researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology” had said that four antibiotics could “stop the virus” in laboratory tests. The study itself, however, reported that the drugs have not been directly tested against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe research paper on which the Mail Online article is based is a review of 120 drugs which have been used in humans before, and which the researchers believe may be active against a range of viruses. The researchers say these drugs would be good places to start to look for a treatment for COVID-19.\nThe majority of the drugs discussed in the review are already used against viruses (antiviral drugs), while some have been used for other infectious diseases such as malaria. The researchers list what stage the research on each drug is at (with laboratory tests the earliest stage and large-scale trials in humans the final stage) and which viruses or groups of viruses the drug has been tested against.\nThe list includes four antibiotics – teicoplanin, oritavancin, dalbavancin and monensin. These have been used in laboratory tests against other coronaviruses, but not against the virus that causes COVID-19. None of them was reported to have been tested beyond basic laboratory tests. Another 41 drugs were also listed as having been tested against one or more coronaviruses.\nIt is not clear why these four drugs were picked up by the Mail article as being of particular interest. None of them is the priority drugs currently being tested in large-scale trials on patients with COVID-19. There are ongoing trials of another antibiotic called azithromycin, which is being tested in combination with antimalarial drugs.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organization says: “Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.

This was based on an interview with one nurse in the US, who said she had noticed that the COVID-19 patients had redness around their eyes.\nThere have been a few documented cases of redness in the whites of the eyes (conjunctivitis) in people with coronavirus. However, red eyes have not been flagged up as a common symptom by symptom trackers or early studies.\nA review of the evidence about signs and symptoms of coronavirus infection found the most commonly-reported were (from most to least common): fever, cough, fatigue, difficulty breathing, sputum (phlegm), shortness of breath, muscle aches, chills, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea and blocked nose.\nHaving red eyes is quite common with respiratory infections, and there can be many other causes including allergies. Therefore, having red eyes doesn’t automatically mean you have coronavirus.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThe Mail Online story was based on an interview with a nurse treating patients at a care home in Washington State broadcast by CNN on March 24. The nurse said: “It’s something that I witnessed in all of them (the patients). They have, like … allergy eyes.”\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology investigated the claims that coronavirus infection was linked to red eyes or conjunctivitis with a review of evidence. It found evidence from five preliminary studies that a very small proportion of patients with COVID-19 may have a viral infection of the eyes. It concluded: “Unless or until the CNN report is confirmed, existing data suggest that conjunctivitis is an uncommon event as it relates to COVID-19.”\nIt recommended that ophthalmologists take precautions when examining patients with signs of conjunctivitis or red eyes, because “it is possible—but not proven—that a patient with COVID-19 associated conjunctivitis could have infectious virus in their ocular secretions.”\nIn the UK, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said in a statement on 19 March: “any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with COVID-19.” It added: “However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to COVID-19 without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where it has occurred.”\nIt advises members to treat patients with signs of conjunctivitis but no other symptoms as usual, with very high levels of infection control.\nThe Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine has been reviewing evidence about signs and symptoms of coronavirus infection in mild, moderate and severe cases since March 24. Their list of commonly reported signs and symptoms does not include red eyes or conjunctivitis.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe NHS continues to state that symptoms of coronavirus infection to look out for are a high temperature and a new, continuous cough.

It can be caused by many different bacteria and viruses, including the novel coronavirus.\nThe vaccination which is currently used to protect older people from pneumonia target a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Unfortunately, this vaccine offers no protection against infection by a coronavirus.\nIt is possible that the vaccination could protect people with coronavirus from getting a Streptococcal pneumonia on top of COVID-19. As yet there is no advice on this from the body that advises UK health departments on immunisation (the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation).\nWhere did the story come from?\nThis claim has been swirling around for some weeks on social media and chat forums. Recently an American specialist in children’s infectious diseases discussed the claim on a YouTube video. She says we don’t yet know if it could help prevent complications of coronavirus, but that older people who would usually get the vaccine should continue to do so.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nEarly reports from China in December 2019 described the first cases of a new type of pneumonia. This was later found to be caused by a novel coronavirus and became known as COVID-19. The virus spread and by March was declared a pandemic.\nThe fact that the virus can cause pneumonia led some people to jump to the conclusion that vaccination against pneumonia might offer protection. However, the existing pneumonia vaccine that is used in older people won’t work against coronavirus. It targets a common bacterial cause of pneumonia, called Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nPeople often confuse diseases caused by bacteria and those caused by viruses. Bacteria are organisms which can live on and in our bodies, while viruses actually enter our cells and use them to make more of themselves.\nVaccines train our bodies’ immune systems to recognise and fight specific infections. A single vaccine targets a single type of bacteria or virus and won’t help the immune system to recognise and fight other different microorganisms. As the virus which causes COVID-19 is new we do not currently have a vaccine against it, but several different groups are trying to develop one.\nWhen people are seriously ill with one infection, they can be more susceptible to catching other infections, which could include infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae. There have been suggestions that some patients who have died of COVID-19 may have died from antibiotic resistant bacterial infections, and that this may be increasing the number of deaths in Italy.\nHowever, we don’t yet have enough information to determine how common secondary infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae are in people with COVID-19, and if people who have been vaccinated have better outcomes.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organization states clearly that vaccines against pneumonia don’t protect against COVID-19. It points out that this infection is completely new, and needs a completely novel type of vaccine. Urgent research work is underway to find one.\nThe WHO does note that although existing pneumonia vaccination won’t protect against COVID-19, it is recommended for protection against respiratory disease. In the UK and US, it is already recommended that all adults aged over 65 should be vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae to prevent pneumonia.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nUniversity Hospitals.

But the pollution is also highest in cities where many people live and work closely together. It is hard to tell whether an increase in deaths from COVID-19 is due to pollution or simply to more cases of COVID-19 where people are more densely concentrated.\nNew research looked at US deaths from COVID-19 up to the 4th of April, and historical pollution data. The researchers adjusted their figures to take population density and other factors into account. They estimated each 1 microgram per metre squared increase in PM2.5 was linked to a 15% increase in a region’s death rate from COVID-19.\nThe study results are important, but the study has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. This means they need more scrutiny.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThe Guardian and several other media outlets reported the study, which was released on the 5th April by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. Prior to this report, the European Public Health Alliance warned in March that air pollution was likely to increase complications or deaths from COVID-19.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe study used historical air quality monitoring data from 3,080 counties in the US, collected from 2000 to 2016, to get an idea of people’s long-term exposure to pollution. The researchers used a US-wide registry of deaths attributed to COVID-19, reported by county. Researchers calculated the ratio of deaths to county population size to get the county level death rate.\nThe researchers found that counties with higher death rates also had higher levels of PM2.5 pollution. Average levels were 8.4 micrograms per metre squared across the US, with a range from less than 3 to more than 12.\nThey adjusted their figures to take account of factors including population density, the proportion of people aged over 65, the proportion with deprivation markers, ethnic background, the proportion of smokers, number of hospital beds, weather, and number of COVID-19 tests.\nAfter adjustment, they said that each additional 1 microgram per metre squared rise in a county’s air pollution increased death rates by 15%. They calculated that in New York County (where the disease has hit hardest) a reduction of 1 microgram per metre squared in PM2.5 pollution might have prevented 248 of 1,905 deaths.\nA study from 2003 looking at deaths from SARS in China, found that people with the disease were more likely to die if they lived in polluted regions. The study looked at different measures of air pollution than the US study and used numbers of people who died compared to the number of cases reported. It did not account for important factors such as whether people smoked.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe WHO has not commented on links between air pollution and COVID-19 deaths. However, in 2014 the organisation said that air pollution may cause 7 million premature deaths annually worldwide, contributing to deaths from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease (including acute respiratory infections such as SARS and COVID-19) and cancer.\nDr Maria Neira, Director of WHO’s Department for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health, said at the time: “Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.”\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nXiao Wu et al.

The patients had all had close contact with people with COVID-19, so they were tested early. Their symptoms were generally mild.\nThe researchers tested for both the genetic material from the virus (the standard test) and also for live virus. They showed that live virus was present in patients’ mouths, noses and throats in the first week of showing symptoms, but not after this. This suggests that people with coronavirus are more infectious in the first week after starting to show symptoms than they are later on.\nThe research does reinforce the importance of self-isolating as soon as you develop symptoms, and continuing to do so for 7 days, even if your symptoms are mild.\n \nWhere did the story come from? \nThe news is based on a recently published study of 9 patients who were diagnosed with coronavirus at one hospital in Germany this January. They all had contact with known COVID-19 patients and were diagnosed once they showed symptoms by testing swabs from their mouths or noses and throats for genetic material from the novel coronavirus.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nAll of the patients had relatively mild symptoms. In most cases (7 out of 9 patients) a cough was one of their initial symptoms.\nThe researchers took regular repeat swabs and other body fluid samples from the patients to assess where the virus was present in the body, and at what levels. This continued until they could not detect the virus any longer (up to about 28 days).\nThese standard tests look for genetic material from the virus, but do not show for certain that live virus is present which could infect other people. Therefore the researchers also tested whether live virus was present in the samples. They showed that there were differences between tests for genetic material and the live virus (meaning infectivity).\nOverall the research found:\n\nThe levels of the virus genetic material in swabs from the nose and mouth or throat were very high in the first 5 days of symptoms and decreased after that. There was detectable virus genetic material in the swabs into the second week after symptoms developed.\nIn most of the patients, it appeared as though the levels of the virus genetic material in the throat had already peaked by the time they first showed symptoms.\nLive virus (that is, a virus that had the potential to infect others) was identified in the first week of symptoms from the swabs from the nose, mouth and throat and also sputum (saliva and mucus from the respiratory tract). After day 8 the researchers were no longer able to find live virus in these samples. This was despite still detecting high levels of the genetic material of the virus.\nWhile virus genetic material was isolated from samples of poo, the researchers never managed to isolate any live virus from it.\n\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThough small, this type of study is important for getting a better idea of when the virus is infectious. Policymakers will review this type of research as it accumulates to decide whether to update their strategies on how best to combat the virus.\nThe symptoms of coronavirus to look out for are high temperature or a new, continuous cough. UK Government advice is that people experiencing these symptoms, however mild, should stay at home and self-isolate for 7 days after symptoms start. If a person still has a high temperature after this time then they should continue to self-isolate until this returns to normal.\nSocial distancing measures and good hand hygiene will reduce the risk of people becoming infected or infecting others i.e. transmission if they unknowingly have the virus.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n1.     Wölfel et al.

(14, 'https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=84010', 'Myth: 5G is causing the coronavirus pandemic', 'The Sun recently reported that YouTube videos are circulating which claim that the new 5G WiFi networks are causing the coronavirus outbreak. They claim that 5G destroys the immune system causing flu-like symptoms and that while it looks like people are dying from a viral infection it is actually the result of exposure to 5G networks.\nThere is currently no evidence to support the theory that 5G causes COVID-19. Our understanding of the biology of this disease, and how it is behaving all support it being caused by the coronavirus.\nCoronavirus is a virus that is known to enter the body through the eyes, mouth or nose. When it arrives in these areas, it can get into a cell and start to reproduce like any other virus. That’s why the best way currently to protect yourself against the virus is to practice social distancing, wash hands with soap and avoid touching your eyes, mouth or nose.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe Sun reported that there are posts on YouTube misinforming people that 5G WiFi is causing the coronavirus outbreak.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\n5G is the newest (“fifth generation”) form of mobile internet connection, which started to be used in 2019. As the name implies, it is intended to replace 4G. It should offer faster data downloads and uploads and allow more mobile devices to access the mobile internet at once. It does this by using a wider range of radio waves than 4G did, including “high-band” radio waves in the 20-100GHz range (called millimetre waves).\nIt is not clear where the myth originated, but seem to be based on the idea that the timing of the current coronavirus outbreak in China coincided with the initial release of 5G there, and suggests that a similar thing happened with the previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS) and previous generations of mobile internet.\nThere are no trustworthy research studies that look at whether 5G causes the coronavirus outbreak. There is no biological basis for considering that 5G could cause this type of disease, which is behaving exactly as one might expect an infectious disease to behave.\nA recent review looked at the potential impact of 5G wireless communication and the health effects associated with it. It looked at research studies published up to the end of 2018 which looked at the impact of exposure to frequencies from 6 to 100GHz. These are the frequencies that 5G networks use but other types of networks don’t. It also considered other relevant literature, for example, documents from the World Health Organization.\nIt analysed 94 relevant studies in human tissue (such as skin), laboratory animals and in cells in the laboratory. None of these studies looked at the impact of these frequencies on human symptoms or health. They found that most studies showed some sort of biological responses but that the methods of the few studies available were very varied. Moreover, there was no consistent relationship between the impacts seen and the nature of the exposure (power density, exposure time or frequency).\nTherefore, these researchers stated that no conclusions could be drawn with respect to the effects on health of exposure at the frequencies studied.  The review was funded by a German telecom company who were reported to have had no role in designing, performing, or publishing the study.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe WHO state that to date “no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies” although “so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.” They add that no consequences for public health are anticipated from these frequencies.\nPublic Health England’s advice on 5G technologies states that currently public of exposures to radio waves are well within the recommendations of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and that UK network providers are committed to staying within these.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n1.     The Sun.

This doesn’t mean that the claim is necessarily untrue, we just need stronger evidence before we can say for sure.\nWhat is clear is that not everyone with COVID-19 reports this symptom, and there are other reasons why you might lose your sense of smell. Cough and fever continue to be the most important symptoms of COVID-19 to look out for.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThere has been widespread media coverage of claims that loss of smell or taste is signs of coronavirus infection. Many of these reported a statement from ENT UK, a professional body representing doctors working in ear, nose and throat specialities in the UK. The statement discussed the evidence and suggested that patients with loss of smell could also be asked to self-isolate.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe statement from ENT UK said that, in South Korea, “30% of patients testing positive [for the novel coronavirus] have had anosmia [loss of sense of smell] as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases.” It also said that “there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms.”\nTo investigate the issue, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine carried out a systematic search and rapid review of the published evidence around the total or partial loss of smell in people with coronavirus. They also consulted with experts.\nThe Centre found no studies from peer-reviewed journals reporting on the loss of sense of smell in COVID-19. Over 50 peer-reviewed studies were identified which reported on symptoms of COVID-19, and none mentioned a loss of smell.\nThe found one small study from China which reported that about 5% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had a partial loss of smell. However, this study had not yet been verified by peer review, so should be taken cautiously.\nThey found that the claim from South Korea was based on a news report quoting a doctor, not on published data. Other reports of patients presenting with a loss of smell came from a private internet message board used by ENT doctors.\nBBC News recently reported that early results from an app that tracks symptoms across the UK. It found 59% of 579 people who reported having coronavirus infection confirmed by a test said they had experienced a loss of smell or taste. However, we don’t know how representative of those with coronavirus this sample is.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organization says: “The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea.” Loss of smell is not mentioned.\nThe Oxford CEBM review concluded: “The current evidence base to suggest changes in olfactory sensation [smell] is a feature of COVID-19 is limited and inconclusive. More evidence is required to establish whether there is a link between changes in olfaction and COVID-19.”  The centre goes on to encourage clinicians assessing suspected cases to incorporate questions around the loss of smell.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nLoss of sense of smell as marker of COVID-19 infection.

That’s why the best way to protect against the virus is to wash hands with soap and avoid touching your eyes, mouth or nose. Once the virus is in your body, drinking water or gargling is unlikely to help.\nGargling is commonly used in some countries as a way to prevent colds and flu, although there is little evidence that this works.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe New York Times reported that there are many posts on social media asking about gargling as a protective measure.\nIn some countries in East Asia, gargling is a common practice and widely believed to reduce infection. It was even part of the recommended pandemic influenza response by the Japanese government.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThere have been no studies looking at whether gargling or drinking hot water, warm water or salted water can protect against the virus that causes Covid-19.\nA review of evidence on whether non-medical interventions can help to slow or stop the spread of flu, carried out in 2015, included two trials of oral hygiene carried out in Japan. One looked at weekly dental hygiene appointments and advice from hygienists for elderly people, which found this reduced oral bacteria and signs of infection in saliva. Another compared gargling with water, povidone iodine mouthwash or usual personal care. It found no significant preventive effects for gargling, or for one type of gargling versus the other. The review concluded that “oral hygiene and handwashing [showed] efficacy.”\nExperts have challenged the view that drinking water or gargling can “wash away” the virus. Speaking to the BBC website, Professor Trudie Lang, professor of Global Health Research at the University of Oxford, said there is “no biological mechanism” for washing a respiratory virus down into your stomach in order to kill it.\nIn the US, Dr Amesh Adalja, Senior Scholar researching emerging infectious diseases at  Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security adds: “While it is true that coronavirus can cause a sore throat and gargling with warm water may make it feel better, it has no direct effect on the virus.”\nDrinking plenty of fluids and staying well-hydrated is generally good health advice, especially if you become unwell. But there is no reason to think this will prevent you from becoming infected.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nHarvard TH Chan School of Public Health says: “There is no evidence that regularly gargling has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.

The danger with very hot baths is that you could burn or scald your skin. But taking a sauna or hot bath will not affect coronavirus if you are already infected. Your core body temperature does not rise in hot conditions.\nThere is a theory that saunas protect against infection because they “boost the immune system” or lead to “detoxification” of the body. It is unclear what is meant by either of these things. The liver automatically breaks down toxins in the body, without help from saunas.\nSharing a public sauna could expose you to infection. If you have your own sauna, you can continue to enjoy it, but it is unlikely to protect you from coronavirus.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nSome sauna manufacturers have made claims that saunas can protect against COVID-19. Manufacturers are unlikely to be reliable sources of information as they have a vested interest in persuading people of the benefits.\nThe Sky story reports that saunas are a good way to stay healthy. However, the source  adds advice to drink vodka and work hard in the fields, without giving any evidence as to how these measures would help.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThere have been no clinical studies looking at whether taking saunas or hot baths can protect against the virus that causes COVID-19.\nCoronaviruses as a group generally survive for short periods of time in raised temperatures and higher humidity, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, we do not know what temperature is needed to inactivate the virus responsible for COVID-19. Also, while hot temperatures might affect viruses on the surface of the body (the skin), they are unlikely to affect the virus once it has infected the body’s cells.\nWe found one small study published in 1990 which seemed to show that people told to take one to two saunas a week were less likely to get a common cold over a 6 month period than those told not to use saunas. However, this study had only 25 volunteers in each arm, so is too small to be conclusive, and participants were not randomly assigned to the groups.\nMore importantly, we do not know whether measures that affect the common cold virus will also affect the virus that causes COVID-19.\nThere is little other evidence from reviews of trials that saunas have any effect on people’s chances of catching infectious airways disease, or on their symptoms if they catch an infection.\nGeneral claims about saunas “boosting the immune system” or “helping detoxification” do not have a scientific basis. It is unclear what the people making the claims mean by these phrases.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organisation says: “Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.”\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nReading list\n\nWorld Health Organisation.

But should we be worried about catching coronavirus from the surfaces of these deliveries?\nResearchers have recently tested how well the new coronavirus survives in the air as an aerosol, and on different surfaces including cardboard, likely to be the material for many of our packages.\nThe researchers found that the virus was no longer detectable 24 hours after it was placed on cardboard. There was a range on other surfaces, from about 4 hours on copper to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks, with the WHO making a similar statement.\nThe findings do highlight the importance of following advice on frequent washing your hands, particularly after touching surfaces that may be contaminated.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nSince the start of the novel coronavirus outbreak people have been concerned about the risks from packages. Initially concerns centred on packages coming from areas where the infection had first taken hold such as China, but as the virus is now more widespread so are the concerns.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nA recent study by researchers at US institutions including Princeton and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has looked at how long the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 lives on surfaces and in the air.\nThey created aerosols containing the virus and also placed the virus on 5 different surfaces under controlled conditions in the laboratory and tested how long it remained potentially infectious. They checked for infectivity of the virus from the aerosol for up to 3 hours, and on the surfaces for up to a week, with each experiment repeated 3 times. All experiments were carried out at 21 to 23°C. The aerosol experiment was carried out at 65% relative humidity, and the surface experiments at 40% relative humidity.\nWhen they tested the aerosol, they found that the number of infectious virus particles in the air decreased over 3 hours, but was still present.\nThe researchers tested how the virus behaved on copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic. They found that it survived longer on plastic and stainless steel (up to about 3 days) than on cardboard and copper (no virus detected after 24 hours and 4 hours respectively).\nThe results for cardboard varied more across the 3 experiments than for other surfaces, so this made the researchers more cautious about them.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe WHO reports that studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for between a few hours and several days, and that this may vary based on factors like the type of surface, or temperature and humidity of the environment. They say that there is both a low chance of commercial goods being contaminated by an infected person and or catching the virus off of a package that has been moved, travelled, and been exposed to different conditions and temperature.\nThe US CDC provides a similar statement, saying that the risk from packages that have been shipped over a period of days or weeks is likely to be low.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n1. van Doremalen et al.

The study has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, but was released early.\nThe study showed blood type A was more common and type O less common in coronavirus patients than in the general population. But that does not mean blood type directly affects coronavirus infectivity. It could be a co-incidence.\nIt is not clear how blood type might affect the chances of being infected with coronavirus. Usually, before people accept that something is a risk factor for an illness, we need a biologically-plausible reason why that might be and strong observational research too.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe story first surfaced in the South China Morning Post, which reported on 17 March that “People with blood type A may be more vulnerable to infection by the new coronavirus, while those with type O seem more resistant.”\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe claims were made in a pre-publication paper by researchers from seven hospitals and universities in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Shanghai, China. The researchers compared the blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test, from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen (including 206 who had died), with that of 27,080 people from “recent surveys” of the general population of Wuhan and Shenzhen.\nThe research reported:\n\n37% of patients with COVID-19 (including 85 who had died) were blood type A, compared to 29% of the general population\n26% of patients with COVID-19 (including 52 who had died) were blood type O, compared to 38% of the general population\n\nThe researchers calculated that people with blood type A were 21% more likely to be infected than people with other blood types (odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.43) and people with blood type O were 33% less likely to be infected than people from other blood groups (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.75). It is not possible to say if a bias in the way people were selected for this study could have accounted for the apparent difference.\nHowever, the results were not consistent for all 3 hospitals. For one hospital in Shenzhen, people with blood type A were no more likely to be infected than those with other types. This may be because there were fewer patients (285) sampled from this hospital.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe WHO and NHS have not commented on the paper.\nCommenting via the Science Media Centre, Dr Sakthi Vaiyapuri, Associate Professor in Cardiovascular and Venom Pharmacology, University of Reading, said: “There is little evidence to substantiate any claim that there [is] any more than a coincidental correlation between blood group ABO and susceptibility of contracting Covid-19.”\nHe said there were “far too many parameters that cast doubt” on their findings, and added: “Importantly, people should not panic about these results as clearly further scientific research is required to substantiate these claims.”\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n1.     Jiao Z et al.

Unpublished clinical studies from China have reportedly found the drug effective.\nThe drug gained prominence at a White House press conference where it was announced that chloroquine had been approved for use in COVID-19 patients by the US Food and Drug Administration. That was not entirely correct. People in Nigeria have reportedly been panic-buying the drug.\nThe World Health Organisation is organising multinational trials of hydroxychloroquine and three other drugs or combinations. On March 8, 23 trials of hydroxychloroquine had been registered.\nDoctors can use treatments for conditions other than those that have been officially approved, a prescribing practice known as “off-label”. But it is also seems wise to gather better evidence to see if chloroquine is safe and effective for treating COVID-19 in larger trials compared to other medication.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nThere have been widespread reports in the media and social media about chloroquine being effective against coronavirus. It makes sense to trial existing drugs, which have been used for other conditions, when looking for ways to treat new viruses.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nDoctors and researchers looking for responses to new infectious agents start with existing drugs known to affect similar agents. In this case, drugs used against previous coronaviruses (such as those that caused SARS and MERS) and known to have anti-viral action, were investigated.\nInterest in chloroquine emerged in February, when a letter published in the journal Cell Research reported that chloroquine was highly effective against coronavirus in laboratory tests. Laboratory testing does not involve people or animals but looks to see whether introducing the drug to a culture of the virus inhibits its growth. The study also found remdesivir, a drug developed to combat Ebola, was highly effective.\nAlso in February, a letter published in BioScience Trends said Chinese trials on “more than 100 patients” had found chloroquine prevented pneumonia from worsening and speeded clearance of the virus. As these trials have not been published and their findings shared we don’t know if they were high quality.\nBecause of interest prompted by the Chinese reports, the WHO decided to include chloroquine in its multi-national trial. The drug will also be tested in a European trial announced this week.\nAn analysis of registered trials of coronavirus research by the UK Centre for Evidence Based Medicine found that 382 studies had been registered by March 8, 23 of them to test chloroquine. These researchers said that the studies from China so far were characterised by poor quality and small sample size.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organisation’s guidance on management of COVID-19 says that there is no current evidence to recommend any specific anti-COVID-19 treatment for patients with confirmed COVID-19. It recommends investigational anti-COVID-19 therapeutics are used in ethically approved, randomised, controlled trials.\nThe US Center for Disease Control also states that there are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with COVID-19. It adds, that there are no currently available data from randomized clinical trials to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n1.     Jianjun G et al.

Some of the posts falsely claim that the advice came from the Stanford Hospital Board or other un-named experts, but Stanford University tweeted to warn the public that misinformation was circulating that was not from them.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe claims circulating suggest that by the time a COVID-19 patient gets a fever or a cough, their lungs are usually filled with ‘50% fibrosis’ and it is already ‘too late’. The breath holding test was said to be a way to detect it early.\nHowever, there are several reasons why this statement is not true.\nLung fibrosis is the scarring or hardening of lung tissue, and it usually takes a long time to develop. It can have various causes including some autoimmune diseases, exposure to certain types of dust, and some prescription drugs.\nLung fibrosis can also be a complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a clinical syndrome which COVID-19 can cause in severe cases. It is dangerous to imply that this can be diagnosed in the home.\nWhile holding your breath might indicate whether you have a cough or shortness of breath, it is not a test for coronavirus.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe NHS 111 online platform for checking for coronavirus symptoms does not include the 10-second breath holding test as a valid way of confirming whether a person is infected with the virus or not.  The NHS website states that the symptoms to look out for are a high temperature or a new, continuous cough, and offers advice on what to do if you experience these. The definitive test for a current coronavirus infection involves testing for the virus’ genetic material in swabs from the respiratory tract.\nIf a healthcare worker suspects that a person has acute respiratory distress or other serious complications as a result of COVID-19 they would quickly arrange transfer to the appropriate zone of a designated hospital.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nUSA TODAY.

Several news sources and international guidelines in the US and UK have addressed this question. So, what does the evidence say so far?\nAs of March 2020, it is highly likely that breastfeeding is safe to start and continue, as there is no evidence to suggest that the virus is found in breastmilk. A lack of evidence of harm is not proof that something is completely safe, but the trusted sources we have identified say that babies of mums with COVID-19 can still choose to breastfeed if they take precautions to reduce the chance of droplet infection.\nLarger studies would be helpful to confirm the findings in the small number of pregnant women studied so far.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nMany news articles have covered the risks of coronavirus in pregnancy, questioning whether pregnant women are at greater risk of catching the disease or being more severely affected and whether breastfeeding is safe for the babies of mothers with the infection.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nA recent study followed nine pregnant women from Wuhan in their third trimesters who had COVID-19. The researchers tested the breastmilk amongst other things such as cord blood and swabbed the babies’ throats when they were born. All these samples tested negative for the virus.\nOne newborn has been reported to have been infected with coronavirus within a day of being born to an infected mother. However, it is not clear whether this infection was transmitted before birth, through breast milk, or might have been passed on afterwards.\nThese initial findings suggest that the virus is unlikely to be passed from infected pregnant women to their babies through breastmilk. However, feeding at the breast does involve close contact, so this does carry the risk of mothers passing on the infection to the infant in this way.\nThe numbers of pregnant women in these studies were relatively low. Guidance from the trusted sources will be updated as more research clarifies this issue.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nUK guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) says that women with coronavirus can breastfeed. It says that there is no evidence showing that the virus can be carried in breastmilk, and the well-recognised benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk.\nThe guidance says that the main risk for babies being breastfed by mothers with COVID-19 is that the close contact could allow droplet transmission once the baby is born, and they outline measures to reduce this risk. This guidance will be kept under regular review as new evidence emerges.\nGuidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that in limited studies on women with COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus has not been detected in breast milk. They also suggest that whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding should be decided by the mother along with her family and healthcare providers.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitations\n\nCoronavirus with a baby: Can I breastfeed while infected with COVID-19?

It is unlikely that the coronavirus, in its first season will be strongly seasonal.\nThe speed at which countries manage to get over the peak in cases will be determined by how well and how fast citizens can implement the advice on social distancing and staying at home to break transmission. This action is more likely to determine when the pandemic will slow than the weather.\nThis false hope was first amplified on social media after a February 10th press conference, in the White House where it was suggested that the coronavirus might simply die out as the weather gets warmer.\nThere are early studies in non-peer reviewed pre-print journals that have quickly sought to collect data or model the infectivity of this virus in different regions and populations. Though promising, none provide high level evidence yet to overturn the idea that it is citizens behaviour supported by their governments actions that will stem the tide of this epidemic later in the year.\nWhere did the story come from?\nMultiple social media sources accounts and commentators have amplified this story in both positive and negative ways.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe idea that warmer weather may stem the spread of the disease comes largely from a comparison with the flu. As a respiratory illness, COVID-19 is similar to the flu. Both viruses spread through respiratory secretions and contaminated surfaces. Both illnesses can cause typically mild respiratory disease that in some cases develops into life-threatening pneumonia. But the chain of transmission can be different for a new virus and we don’t yet know enough about the virus SARS-CoV-2.\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology review published on the 19th of March used data compiled by John Hopkins University to investigate the rates of transmissions with coronavirus in regions of the world where temperatures range between 3 and 13°C. on that date 5% cases were observed in countries where temperatures were above 18°C.\nThese authors emphasis that the proper social distancing, quarantine and isolation measures will be required to effectively reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus) and protect those people who are at risk of more serious COVID-19 (the disease).\nEcological studies and modelling of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in different climates data have recently been published. So far many have not gone through a peer reviewed process and so provide low-level evidence of a link to weather or temperature. The first study models monthly variation in climate and likely transmission of the virus throughout the year. The authors found that the coronavirus displays a preference for cool and dry conditions over hot and humid ones.\nThe authors of another study conducted in China calculate the daily reproductive number (R0), a measure of how many people are infected by each primary case across different Chinese cities. In cites with more than 40 cases an associaton between high temperature and humidity with lower transmission (R0) was found after controlling for the population density.\nEarly research like this will need to be repeated in more countries before anyone can be confident of links between transmission and climate.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe World Health Organization noted that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including those with hot and humid weather.\nThe Centres for Disease Control and Prevention mention that it is not currently known whether temperature and warm weather will have an impact on the spread of COVID-19.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nMIT Technology Review.

(25, 'https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83860', 'Myth: Pet cats and dogs are spreading coronavirus', 'After reports from Hong Kong of a pet dog with a ‘low level of infection’ with the novel coronavirus, some people worried about whether pets can catch the virus, or whether they can catch the virus from cats and dogs.\nWhile the dog in question did have the virus in its mouth and nose, it didn’t develop any symptoms. There are no reports of any other pets becoming ill with COVID-19.\nThere is no current evidence that pets such as cats and dogs can transmit the virus to people and there are no reports of people being infected by pets. People ill with COVID-19 are advised to restrict their handling of pets and if possible to have them cared for by someone else.\nEveryone should take sensible precautions when handling pets, such as washing hands properly afterwards, and not letting pets lick them on the face.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nAt the end of February, the Hong Kong government’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department reported that the pet dog of a patient with COVID-19 had tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong. This prompted questions about whether pets could be spreading the virus, and whether they should be put into quarantine.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe test for the coronavirus looks for the presence of its genetic material (called RNA). Tests on the pet dog by the Hong Kong authorities found a small quantity of this RNA in its nose and mouth five days after it had been removed from the patient’s home. It was unclear whether there were intact coronaviruses (which could be infectious) or just pieces of RNA, which would not be infectious. Blood tests later showed that the dog was not producing detectable levels of antibodies against the coronavirus. This means it’s less likely that the virus was widespread in the dog.\nThe report said the dog had shown no signs of disease and it was likely that the virus had been transmitted to the dog from the dog’s owner, who was sick with COVID-19. As a result of their findings the Hong Kong government recommended that cats, dogs or other mammalian pets from families where someone had confirmed COVID-19 should be put into quarantine.\nHowever, the statement acknowledged that there is “no evidence at this time that mammalian pet animals including dogs and cats could be a source of infection to other animals or humans.”\nSARS-CoV-2 (the official name for the virus causing the current human outbreak) is a beta-coronavirus. Alpha- and beta-coronaviruses usually infect mammals, while gamma-  and  delta-coronaviruses  usually  infect  birds  and  fish. Coronaviruses known to infect dogs (canine coronavirus) and cats (feline coronavirus) are both alpha-coronaviruses and not linked to the current outbreak. Some strains of coronavirus can be transmitted between humans and animals, but many strains cannot.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe WHO says: “While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19.”\n \nThe World Organisation for Animal Health said: “The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human to human transmission. To date, there is no evidence that companion animals can spread the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare.”\n \nThe organisation added: “When possible, people who are sick or under medical attention for COVID-19 should avoid close contact with their pets and have another member of their household care for their animals.”\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitation\n\nThe Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

(26, 'https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83849', 'Can you catch coronavirus twice?', 'As more people start getting COVID-19, an important question for planning the coronavirus response is: can they catch it twice?\nSome reports have suggested that some people who recover from COVID-19 can then test positive for the virus again shortly after. The limited research conducted so far suggests that this might be because of fluctuations in people’s viral levels rather than reinfection. This research only looked at 4 people, so the issue isn’t settled yet.\nBecause of the way our immune systems work, it seems unlikely that a person who has successfully fought off the novel coronavirus would get infected again in a short period of time. Initial research in monkeys supports this.\nSome viruses like the flu can change enough to evade the immune system and infect people again and antibody levels can fade, but these things take time. It’s too early as yet to know how immunity to the novel coronavirus might develop or how the virus might change in the long term.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nIn February a Japanese woman who had recovered from COVID-19 and tested negative for the virus, developed symptoms and tested positive again about 20 days later. China has also reportedly had similar cases. These cases led to people questioning whether it was possible to get the novel coronavirus twice.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nIt’s very difficult to know for sure the reason behind the cases above. While reinfection is one explanation it is also possible that people’s infections never went away but were temporarily undetected. This might happen because viral levels were low.\nA Chinese study has reported on the follow-up of 4 medical professionals after recovery from COVID-19 and testing negative for the virus. All had been treated with an antiviral drug used to treat flu (oseltamivir).\nIt found that all 4 had throat swab tests positive for coronavirus again 5 to 13 days after leaving hospital. None of them had symptoms or had any changes to their lungs at the time.\nThis is a relatively small number of mild to moderate cases, and it’s not possible to say for sure that the same would be seen in all cases. The researchers did thorough testing for the virus, carrying out multiple tests to check their results. They suggest that the findings reflected people still being carriers, as they had not been in contact with any other people with respiratory symptoms who could have reinfected them.\nWhile the study suggests that the people may still have had coronavirus in their throats, we don’t know if they were producing enough to be infectious. None of the people living with them at the time caught coronavirus from them.\nEarly stage research in 2 rhesus monkeys who were infected with the novel coronavirus found that they did not catch it again when re-exposed a month later. This small study has not yet been checked for robustness by other researchers so is not conclusive.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that the immune response to the novel coronavirus is not yet understood. They say that people who caught the coronavirus that causes MERS were unlikely to be re-infected shortly after recovery, but that it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19.\nThis week the UK’s government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said that while some people do catch infectious diseases a second time, it is rare. He said there was no evidence to suggest that this would happen with the novel coronavirus.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitations\n\nCoronavirus: Japanese woman tests positive for second time.

For example, Chinese officials have claimed that they will have a vaccine ready next month to be used for this pandemic. A vaccine manufacturer  claims to have shipped vials of an mRNA vaccine against the virus for the first phase 1 testing.\nThough this is promising news some caution is required as the vaccine manufacturing process and safety testing is typically very thorough. There are several safety criteria need to be met before a vaccine is approved for widespread use. Some vaccines can take more than 5 years to be proven safe, effective and for production processes to be consistent enough for them to enter the market.\nThere are reports of several vaccines in development and mRNA vaccines are one promising type. Best estimates are that with fast-track processes for approval it will be 12-18 months before a licensed vaccine for coronavirus could be ready for wide use.\nWhere did the story come from?\nIn Beijing, the director of the National Health Commission’s Science and Technology Development Centre claimed in the South China Morning Post that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready next month. He said it is to be used for emergency situations and clinical trials, and eight institutes in China are working on different approaches to fight COVID-19. Sometime in April they hope to have the vaccine available.\nModerna Therapeutics, a US biotechnology company, has developed a synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine that they say was “handed” to the heads of the US government for testing.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThis global pandemic has affected more than 130,000 people and killed almost 5000 worldwide according to WHO data (12th March). The genetic code for the virus was sent out by email to many research institutes very quickly after the viral genome was characterised. The WHO is supporting efforts to develop a vaccine.\nThe two claims that a vaccine will be ready in a few weeks caused excitement at a press conference in the White House on March 2. Anthony Fauci, the respected head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, clarified his view of the claim saying “You wouldn’t have a vaccine. You would have a vaccine to go into testing.”\nThese mRNA vaccines have been previously tested for Zika and were produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, CureVac, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, amongst others. They have received an FDA Fast track designation, meaning there is a precedent for prioritising approval if safe and effective. However, the reality is that these new technologies and vaccines have yet to be shown to work.\nThis is an exciting and fast-moving field of research with promising progress being made. For example, in 2018 a DNA vaccine has reportedly been licensed in China to prevent H5 subtype avian influenza infection in chickens.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nA recent overview from the University of Pennsylvania looked at the complexity and costs of vaccine manufacturing and it suggests that the regulatory requirements can be challenging for the vaccine manufacture industry. The steps that are necessary to produce a vaccine that is ‘safe, effective and consistent’ are difficult to execute over the life cycle of a vaccine.\nThis overview also found that most manufacturers typically have a vaccine portfolio which mitigates the high fixed costs of manufacturing in global markets but the production challenges for global vaccines can extend the time to reach required scale. An estimate of the time required, production and research phases, for bringing a product to the international market ranges was estimated at between five and eighteen years.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that the best way to prevent COVID-19 illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. It seems that fast track processes may allow a new coronavirus vaccine to be tested in large trials by early next year.\n \nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nCitations\n\nSouth China Morning Post.

Public Health England say spending more than 15 minutes speaking to or within two metres of person with the COVID-19 virus, could mean you catch the virus, so having sex is clearly off the cards.\nPeople also worry that this respiratory virus can transmit like HIV or Zika. No evidence so far suggests that they are. It seems that the risk of contracting the virus is greater from kissing.\nAt this point in the UK, there’s no reason not to have sex if you know your partner well, don’t have symptoms, haven’t been in contact with anyone with coronavirus and aren’t in self- isolation because you have been to high risk countries.\nAs Dr Muhammad Munir of Lancaster University said to the Guardian yesterday “Coronavirus itself is not a sexually transmitted disease.”\n \nWhere did these stories come from?\nReuters reports that sales of condoms have increased in China since the coronavirus outbreak.  Not all may be being used as you might expect. Some media channels have reported that people are using condoms to protect their fingers when calling for a lift.  Such stories might make good clickbait but risk confused messaging and rarely provide helpful information.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nWhen new viruses emerge, it takes time to fully understand them and how they spread, so understandably people worry and want to take precautions. The WHO say that the main way that the novel coronavirus spreads is through droplets produced when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. They will continue to look into ongoing research and share additional information as it arises.\nWe identified no relevant research on whether semen or vaginal fluid of people with COVID-19 contains the live coronavirus. There is some initial evidence that the virus can be found in faeces but similarly the risk of contracting the virus from this route, is not yet certain.\nEven if coronavirus can’t be sexually transmitted, this doesn’t mean that having sex is a risk-free activity. The close contact and kissing involved in having sex offer an opportunity for the virus to be passed on through droplets and saliva. So, if your partner has symptoms of a respiratory infection, or have recently been to a high risk area, or in contact with a person with coronavirus, you may want to make do with a brief elbow bump for the time being.\nAvoid close contact with them, including sex.\nYou may also want to be cautious if you don’t know your partner very well and therefore aren’t sure of their likelihood of being infected.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nSeveral resources are available from trusted sources such as the WHO to advise on what social distancing measures can be taken in the different circumstances countries find themselves in.\nSocial distancing aims to reduce the possibility of new infections by reducing contact between individuals when community spread outstrips the ability to find possible cases through contact tracing.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) describe several progressive layers of social distancing for individuals and groups. Individual measures include:\n\nIsolation of confirmed or suspected cases\nQuarantine of healthy contacts of cases\nStay-at-home recommendations for the public as a whole\n\n \nGroup measures include, for example, closure of educational institutions, and cancellation of mass gatherings. As the coronavirus outbreak progresses, more of these measures may be advised and people should keep up to date with the latest government advice.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benckiser\n \nReading list\n\nWorld Health Organization.

For example, some people have become concerned about re-useable water bottles; but is this concern warranted?\nAs the coronavirus is found in saliva and mucus, it is probable that sharing a water bottle (or any drinking vessel) with an infected person could pass on the infection, but people are unlikely to be doing this. Probably more importantly avoiding contamination of the bottle (particularly the drinking spout) with virus-containing droplets directly from coughs, sneezes, sharing or through dirty hands, makes common-sense.\nThe best advice to minimise the risks of transmission of any infectious disease is still good hygiene. This includes not sharing water bottles with others, daily washing of water bottles, and regular handwashing. People can also fill their water bottles at home if they are worried about using public drinking water dispensers, but in-fact there is no evidence we found that these are likely to be a significant source of viral infection.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nHeightened awareness of hygiene and risk of coronavirus has led people to question the cleanliness and hygiene of a range of places and objects, including cash, gyms and re-useable water bottles.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe hygiene of reusable water bottles has come into question a number of times in the past. Some research has suggested that they can harbour bacteria, but it’s unclear how often this is the case, and whether this is having any impact on human health. Despite increasing use of water bottles in recent times, there is little research on this. Existing studies mostly relate to the safety of the water itself and the materials from which the bottles are made rather than the risks from external contamination of the bottle.\nWhile viruses such as the coronavirus can live outside of the body for a short period of time, they can’t multiply outside of the body like bacteria or fungi can. So coronavirus won’t be “breeding” in your water bottle. Tests on other coronaviruses suggest that they can survive on surfaces for between 2 hours and 9 days (depending on factors such as the type of surface and conditions) if not disinfected.\nIn its information about water provision in schools, the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland gives tips on water bottles including:\n\nWater bottles should not be shared\nIdeally bottles should be clear plastic\nWater bottles should be washed daily in warm soapy water, rinsed, and left to air dry upside down\nNozzles of a sports cap should be opened and flushed through during cleaning\nBottles can also be washed in a dishwasher, with bottle and cap separated\nA sterilising agent can also be used to clean drinking vessels and bottles.\n\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe major public health bodies such as the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have not specifically produced guidance on reusable water bottles during the coronavirus outbreak.\nIn terms of the safety of drinking water itself, the WHO has stated that coronavirus has not been detected in drinking water supplies, and risk to the water supply is low. It has also reinforced its general water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management principles. This includes that frequent and proper hand hygiene is one of the most important measures that can be used to prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare, supported by Reckitt Benkiser\n \nCitation\nTorres M.

(31, 'https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83757', 'Myth: Airport temperature screening for arriving passengers can ‘stop’ coronavirus', 'Some countries have been using screening measures at borders, such as taking travellers’ temperatures, to try and stop people with the novel coronavirus entering. Can this approach work?\nUnfortunately these measures alone are not able to completely stop the virus. A recent study suggested that almost half (46%) of novel coronavirus cases would be missed by temperature screening alone. This is because some travellers may be infected but not yet showing symptoms such as fever.\nResearch looking at entry screening in previous outbreaks of diseases such as SARS and pandemic flu also suggests that it identified either very few or no cases. However, it may provide an opportunity to educate travellers about the disease and what to do if they develop symptoms.\nIn the early stages of the outbreak the WHO advised screening of passengers leaving areas with ongoing community transmission of the virus, such as in China, where the virus was most common. The UK government currently requires flights and ships from high risk countries to provide a declaration stating that all their passengers are well before landing or docking.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nSome countries have restricted entry from the countries which are badly affected by COVID-19. Other countries have started using screening measures on entry such as temperature screening for passengers arriving from high risk countries. In Wuhan, where the outbreak began, airport temperature screening was also used in the early stages to stop infected passengers leaving the area.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nWhen a new infectious disease arises, stopping infected people from travelling and spreading it further makes sense, but often few people are infected and identifying them quickly and reliably can be a challenge. For infectious diseases which cause a fever, taking people’s temperatures when they exit or enter a country is one technique. This approach has been used in the past for the H1N1 influenza pandemic, Ebola, and SARS (another coronavirus).\nHowever, a 2019 systematic review found that the existing evidence on entry and exit screening for infectious disease outbreaks suggested that the measures detected either no or very few cases for diseases such as SARS. The few studies that reported costs for screening for SARS and pandemic flu suggested that these measures were expensive to implement and consideration should be given to whether the money would be better spent on other measures.\nHowever, the review noted that there may be other benefits from screening. For example, the measures may discourage ill people from travelling, raise awareness and educate the traveling public, and also allow flights from/to the affected areas to continue operating.\nThe review suggested that exit screening might be a higher priority than entry screening, and noted it has more commonly been recommended by the WHO in past outbreaks.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has stated that “There is evidence that checking people at the airport (known as entry screening) is not very effective in preventing the spread of the virus, especially when people do not have symptoms. It is generally considered more useful to provide those arriving at airports with clear information explaining what to do if they develop symptoms after arrival.”\nThe WHO similarly state that using temperature measurement alone for entry screening may not be very effective. They recommend that if it is implemented, governments should also take other measures such as collecting other relevant information from travellers and having systems in place to rapidly act on the data collected.\n \nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare\n \nCitation\n\nAssociate Press.

The “L” type appears to have arisen by developing two genetic changes compared to the older “S” type. Despite being newer the L type appears more common, suggesting that it might be better at infecting and spreading among humans.\nThere is no need to be alarmed by these findings.\nThey come from 103 samples of the virus collected in different countries, at different times by different laboratories. This is a tiny sample of the virus that has caused COVID-19 in more than 100,000 people.\nWe don’t know whether this is a representative sample of the circulating viruses, so we can’t be certain that the L type is more common. We also have no information as yet on whether one type is more severe.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nMany news sources have covered the findings of this study by researchers from Peking University and other centres in China. For example, the Sun headline was that “Coronavirus has ‘mutated’ into TWO strains – with the most aggressive infecting 70% of patients, scientists claim”.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe claim comes from research that analysed voluntarily submitted, publically available genetic data from 103 samples of the novel coronavirus collected from infected individuals, and also data from other coronaviruses.\nThe researchers found 149 genetic differences between the novel coronaviruses isolated from different people, most of which only occurred in one sample. The coronaviruses mostly fell into two types, based on the presence or absence of changes at two places in their genetic code. The researchers called these the “S” type (about 30% of the samples) and the “L” type (about 70% of the samples).\nThe S type of the virus appeared to be older but less common than the L type. This led researchers to suggest that the L type “might be more aggressive and spread more quickly”.\nAlmost all of the coronaviruses collected before early January (all of which were from Wuhan where the outbreak started) were of the L type (96%), but fewer of those collected after this (62%). The researchers suggest that this may be because the preventive measures have had more of an impact on the L type than the S type, but acknowledge that as yet the data is very patchy, so they would need more information before they can be sure of this.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe researchers themselves say that it is not clear whether the L type causes more severe disease (“is more virulent”) than the S type. As yet we have very limited information on the genetics of the circulating viruses, and how genetic variations might impact severity or infectiousness in humans, or in cells or animals in the laboratory.\nAs Dr Michael Skinner, Reader in Virology at Imperial College London has put it, “The authors reasonably construct some tentative hypotheses which can now usefully be tested as we gather more sequences elsewhere.” But cautions that “It is, however, too early to speculate on any practical consequences of the interesting observation”.\nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare\nCitation\n1.     Tang X et al.

(33, 'https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83734', 'Myth: Coronavirus is no worse than the flu', 'Many healthy, young people who are exposed to the coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, or indeed no symptoms at all. This appears to be true but could also be falsely reassuring.\nThe overall profile of the disease, including its mortality and ability to spread, is now better understood. The health, social and economic impact on large numbers of people means that the disease, COVID-19, is clearly more serious than seasonal influenza.\nCalculating mortality in the earlier phases of an epidemic can be deceptive. It was unclear, for example, how many people with mild symptoms in China were not being diagnosed in the first few weeks of February. This could have led to some early overestimation of the mortality rate. However, the extent of this is likely to be small says Bruce Aylward, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response.\nCase fatality rates vary markedly by age, and so population age structure and treatment availability will determine the final rates observed outside China. The “best” estimate of the death rate in known cases (case fatality rate) seems to be from 1% to 4%.  This is likely to be as accurate as anyone can say at the current time and is more than the flu. This still represents a lot of people if the virus spreads, and reinforces the current drive to contain the spread of the virus.\nWhere did the story come from?\nMany mainstream and social media have covered the question of mortality recently including health sites and newspapers. It is well known that “fear stories” in headlines can sell newspapers.\nTo their credit, most news sources covering death rates reported from the existing outbreak area, and have provided balanced data and facts on this important question, even if the detail lies below the headline or link.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nDr Aylward , reporting for the WHO, has described the profile of cases in the early stages of the outbreak in China: about 80% of cases were mild, about 14% severe, and about 6% of people became critically ill. The case fatality rate was then between 2% and 4% in Hubei province, and 0.7% in other parts of China, he said.\nSeasonal flu, with a case fatality rate of around 0.1% is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nSeasonal influenza, pandemic flu (such as H1N1) and SARS, another coronavirus, are natural comparators for these outbreaks, but they are all different diseases with different case fatality rates and profiles.\nSeasonal influenza is preventable in more than 70% of people with a vaccine and has low mortality, 0.1% approximately. Because the virus circulates widely in winter months a large number of people can be infected, and those over 65 years or with other health conditions are at higher risk.\nThe CDC reports that the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic flu, commonly known as swine flu, led to an estimated 151,000 to 575,000 deaths worldwide in 2009. The estimated global death rate was very low at 0.02%.\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported on the 2002 outbreak of SARS. This disease emerged at the end of 2002 in China and led to more than 8000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. At that time, 10% of people who contracted SARS died.\n \nAnalysis by EIU Healthcare\n \nCitation\n\nGroth L.

(34, 'https://www.covid-19facts.com/?p=83720', 'Myth: Children are “safe” from coronavirus', 'Airway infections such as coughs and colds are common among children, and they often pass these on to parents and other carers. So are they themselves at greater (or less) risk from catching the new coronavirus?\nEarly signs suggest that while children can get COVID-19, their risk appears to be relatively low and they are usually mildly affected. While this should be of some comfort to parents it does not mean that we should be complacent. Even if a child is only mildly affected they can still pass on the infection to adults, who may develop more serious complications. Also if most cases in children are mild, not all may be being detected.\nSteps such as washing hands regularly and not touching mouth, nose, or eyes with unclean hands are key to avoiding infection in people of all ages. These help to protect both the individual themselves and those around them.\n \nWhere did the story come from?\nAll parents know that infections such as the winter vomiting bug (norovirus) or chickenpox can spread like wildfire through nurseries and schools. Therefore the obvious concern with a new virus, like the one that causes COVID-19, is that children could be more susceptible. However, more recent news has suggested that children may be “safe” from coronavirus.\n \nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak emerged bodies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stepped in to address anticipated fears that children might be more susceptible or more severely affected.\nSuch fears would be understandable given that the disease has often been compared with flu, a disease which children can be key in spreading and which can have serious consequences. In fact, flu is reportedly more likely to result in hospitalisation in preschool children than any other age group, although death rates are low.\nHowever, as more data has been collected it looks like relatively few confirmed COVID-19 cases have been in children, and that they are relatively mildly affected.\nThe largest published study of coronavirus so far has come from China where the outbreak started. This study found that just over 2% of confirmed cases were in children and young people aged up to 19 years old. Only one death had been reported in this age group (about 0.1% of those affected).\nA small Chinese study reported that COVID-19 in children was generally mild, but some children did show signs of having pneumonia. Parents do still need to ensure that their children wash their hands just like adults, and if they are infected, take the recommended precautionary measures.\n \nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe initial research findings have allayed some fears about COVID-19 in children. However, there is still much we don’t know, and children cannot be ignored in preventive measures or planning for combating the disease.\nOn February 28th the WHO said “Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild,” with those under 19 years making up only 2.4% of the total cases.\nThe UK government has issued specific guidance for educational settings on preventing and dealing with COVID-19. School closures are among the measures that the UK government will consider to slow the spread of the disease if it does become established here.\n \nCitation\n\nScott S.

There is currently no evidence that homeopathic remedies can reduce the chance of getting COVID-19, or treat it. This means they should not be being promoted for this purpose and medicines regulators have asked for at least one such social media post to be removed.\nBased on what we already know about homeopathic remedies it is extremely unlikely that they would be able to prevent COVID-19. A UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report from 2010 concluded that studies have shown that homeopathic remedies are no more effective than placebo, and there is no scientific basis for expecting them to have an effect.\nWhere did the story come from?\nVarious web and social media posts, such as this one, have been suggesting that regularly taking homeopathic remedies can help people to avoid COVID-19. Indeed, the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) in India has also made a similar suggestion.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe claim is based on homeopathic theories and not on research evidence.\nHomeopathy has been used since the 18th century, and is based on the idea that substances that cause certain symptoms can also help treat those symptoms if given at a very, very low dosage. The relevant substances are diluted in water until there is almost none left.\nBased on the symptoms of COVID-19, homeopaths have suggested remedies that they believe may help prevent the disease or treat it.\nNo research evidence to support these claims was identified through searches of databases of ongoing studies or published studies. No ongoing trials testing whether homeopathic remedies can prevent or treat COVID-19 were identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov trial registry as of 4th March 2020. No published studies testing the impact of homeopathy for prevention or treatment of coronavirus were identified in a search of the research literature catalogued in PubMed (4th March 2020).\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nAs no published evidence on homeopathy for COVID-19 was identified, we looked at evidence on homeopathy for respiratory infections more broadly.\nA Cochrane systematic review from 2018 looked at homeopathic remedies for preventing or treating acute respiratory tract infections in children. It found no benefit of homeopathic remedies compared with placebo. In 2015 the Australian Government’s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) assessed evidence on the use of homeopathy to treat a range of health conditions. They concluded that there was no reliable evidence that homeopathy was more effective than placebo for treating upper respiratory tract infections or flu-like illness.\nCitation\n\nMahon B.

Despite the fact that live COVID-19 particles have been found in faecal specimens by researchers in China, this is unlikely to be the main way in which this virus spreads.\nSo far the virus appears to be spread like most other respiratory viruses.  Spread to others who come into direct contact with virus-containing droplets generated when an infected person exhales, coughs or sneezes. The virus may also be transmitted via contact with surfaces where droplets have landed such as utensils, clothes, or other surfaces.\nWashing hands and avoiding touching your mouth and nose with unclean hands remains the main advice for breaking the transmission of this virus.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe Bloomberg website carried this story on the 20th February.\nThe story quoted a spokesperson from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention who said “This virus has many routes of transmission, which can partially explain” its rapid spread.\nWhat is the basis for the claim?\nThe main evidence behind this story appears to be two recent studies by Chinese researchers (Zhang et al. 2020a and Zhang et al. 2020b). These researchers identified coronavirus genetic material in the faeces of infected patients, and some evidence that live virus was present.\nThe speed of spread of COVID-19 on a cruise ship (the Diamond Princess) was also cited as showing similarities with norovirus, a tummy bug that causes diarrhoea and vomiting and is spread by the faecal-oral route. Norovirus can survive on surfaces allowing rapid spread of the disease in confined spaces such as cruise ships.\nWhile the evidence suggests that it is possible that coronavirus could spread through the faecal-oral route via contaminated surfaces, without additional corroboration it is probably too soon to imply that this is a major way in which the virus spreads. More research into the possibility of faecal-oral transmission is needed.\nWhat do trusted sources say?\nThe WHO has confirmed that COVID-19 virus has been detected in respiratory, faecal and blood samples from infected patients.\nHowever, it has reaffirmed that COVID-19 is mainly transmitted via direct contact of virus-containing droplets and people’s eyes, noses or mouths, or contact with objects and surfaces that these droplets land on.\nThe WHO states that the risk of catching COVID-19 from faeces appears to be low, and the faecal-oral route does not appear to be a driver of COVID-19 transmission at present.\nGood hand hygiene will help prevent both droplet transmission and any faecal-oral transmission.\nAnaylsis by EIU Healthcare \nCitation\n\nGale J.

It is incorrect to claim that there is nothing that can be done in this regard as it’s reasonable to make assumptions based on previous experience.”\nAs this is a new strain of Coronavirus, no commercial products can yet be tested by any company for effectiveness against this new strain. That does not mean that they won’t be proved to be effective once companies are in a position to carry out the appropriate tests.  Until such tests are complete, the best we can do as individuals is to rely on proven best practice hygiene, taking prudent steps to mitigate risk based on the experience from previous Coronavirus strains and similar viruses. From that perspective, there are products that have demonstrated effectiveness against pathogens from the same family as the new virus, such as SARS and MERS. Based on the evidence available to us, and knowledge of the new virus we would anticipate the same measures and products to be effective against the new strain. Definitive scientific confirmation of effectiveness can only be provided once testing against Covid-19 has been conducted, following release of the strain by relevant health authorities.”\nSource: Dr Bruce Charlesworth, Chief Medical Officer – Relief, Hygiene and Wellness, RB\n\n'),

It does not have a clear scientific definition. When using the term, people are normally referring to a person that infects more people than usual. But we should be guided by the statistics. On average, the carrier of the infection infects two to three people with the virus. This is an average and some infect fewer whilst some infect more. Those that infect more people usually do so because they come into contact with a large number of people due to their work or living conditions and that often occurs before they show any symptoms.\nSource: Dr Narendra Saini, Chairman, Scientific Committee, Delhi Medical Council\n\n'),

However, a healthy life-style including balanced diet has a positive significance in maintaining an immune system against virus attack.\nFrom clinical observations, the mortality of some patients with underlying diseases is relatively high, which is partly due to insufficient nutritional support. Especially for novel coronavirus patients, they are often observed with problems of olfactory failure and poor appetite. At this point, patients need to be reminded of taking adequate nutrition. For critically ill and emergent patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition support is particularly important.

The findings are part of a new multi-national public opinion poll by Harris Interactive and RB, the maker of Dettol and Lysol.\n \nThe survey showed that:\n54% handwash more often\n44% avoid crowds\n41% use hand-sanitiser more often\n34% wear masks more often\n32% stay home more often\n31% avoid travel\n \nThe vast majority of people (95%) are aware of the virus outbreak, but the levels of concern about the personal risk from infection differ according to geography.  Globally, 66% of respondents said that are worried for their family and their own safety. The survey revealed that countries closer to the epicentre of the virus outbreak, including India, Malaysia and Thailand and China, expressed the highest levels of concern about contracting the virus (92%, 91%, 86% and 84% respectively).  These countries also report the highest levels of personal actions taken to prevent exposure to infection such as handwashing.\nBritish and German respondents appear to be the least concerned about the virus but many still report modifying their behaviours such as handwashing (35% UK, 40% Germany), using hand sanitisers more often (26% UK, 26% Germany) or wearing masks (6% UK, 5% Germany). Globally, the majority of people believe that good hygiene will protect them, especially in the countries with highest levels of COVID-19 infection.\n“This survey shows that while concern about the novel coronavirus is high, it is encouraging to see that people are already adapting their hygiene behaviours such as handwashing,” said Dr Lisa Ackerley, a Chartered Environmental Health Practitioner and Hygiene Expert.  “Not only will this help to protect against coronavirus infection, but the simple action of hand hygiene at key moments helps guard against other respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.”\nThe survey found some differences in attitudes and behaviours between gender, with women (57%) more likely than men (51%), to have adopted increased handwashing and hand sanitising behaviours.  Older respondents, those of 65+ years who tend to be most at risk of complications from infections, were less likely to say they had changed their handwashing behaviour.\nDr Ackerley also advocates for the concept of ‘destination handwashing’ that centres around washing your hands when you arrive at a destination to help prevent the spread of infection.  “When you arrive home, at work, at a restaurant, or at the gym, these are moments to trigger reminders for handwashing,” she said.  “Simply keeping your hands away from your face when travelling is also a useful tip to reduce the risk of transferring viruses from dirty hands to the eyes, nose or mouth.”\nThe global spread of the novel strain of coronavirus (named SARS-Cov-2) has led to an epidemic of a different kind; the spreading of inaccurate news about the virus has been called an ‘infodemic’ by the World Health Organisation.[i]\nWith so much information about the global health emergency, there is also an increasing risk of misinformation or the proliferation of myths about how consumers can combat the virus.  There is clear need to make sure that information is accurate and from trusted sources.  The survey showed most people turn to international and local health authorities as their most trusted source of information on COVID-19, followed by international and local news outlets.\nThe survey is the latest in a programme of efforts to support the fight against the spread of the virus and to increase knowledge for consumers worldwide.  RB recently announced two major donations; £5.5 million in cash and hygiene products to China through its Dettol brand and additional RMB £550,000 cash donation to support expectant mothers in Hubei Province through its infant nutrition MJN business.\n“We encourage good hygiene practices to break the chain of infection at all times, but it is vital to increase awareness during times of increased concern or when new outbreaks such as COVID-19 occur,” said Dr Bruce Charlesworth, Chief Medical Officer for RB.\nThe survey was conducted with 11,000 adults across 11 countries:  Australia, China, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States. The online survey with ten questions was fielded from 6-11 February 2020.\n[i] Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Situation Report – 13.
