                  'the highest possible level of health."It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, ' \
                  'with six semi-autonomous regional offices and 150 field offices worldwide. \nThe WHO was ' \
                  'established in 7 April 1948, which is commemorated as World Health Day. The first meeting of the ' \
                  'World Health Assembly (WHA), the agencys governing body, took place on 24 July 1948. The WHO ' \
                  'incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations Health Organisation and ' \
                  'the Office International d Hygi√®ne Publique, including the International Classification of ' \
                  'Diseases. Its work began in earnest in 1951 following a significant infusion of financial and ' \
                  'technical resources.\nThe WHOs broad mandate includes advocating for universal healthcare, ' \
                  'monitoring public health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting human ' \
                  'health and well being. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health ' \
                  'standards and guidelines, and collects data on global health issues through the World Health ' \
                  'Survey. Its flagship publication, the World Health Report, provides expert assessments of global ' \
                  'health topics and health statistics on all nations. The WHO also serves as a forum for summits and ' \
                  'discussions on health issues.\nThe WHO has played a leading role in several public health ' \
                  'achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, ' \
                  'and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, ' \
                  'particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart ' \
                  'disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance ' \
